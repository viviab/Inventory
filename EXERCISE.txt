- Design and implement API layer to model and support the below requirements. You do not need to develop a UI for it, unless it helps you.
- In memory data structure is okay (no database code needed)
- Write tests
- Please write production-quality code and provide a runnable solution (at least from tests as entry points)
- Document your approach, assumptions, reasoning, and any notes you want to add for extensibility, maintainability, security, performance, etc, that you don't have time to implement.
